In retrospect everyone agrees this was an unforced error.The hole itself was no secret. At dusk, great clouds of infernal bats vomited forth from the gateway. At dawn, voices could be heard discussing infernal lunch plans.

          <p>Life was tough for the hardy villagers of the Ikrusk. They survived freezing winters in the shadow of Mt Tragedy by huddling around pools of the hellfire that rained eternally from its peak. A good summer was when the scorpion swarms thinned out the vampires. By day they would tend livestock.

          <p>Thanks to Loki and his gambling ways, a pair of upstart Dwarven smiths from Nidavellir made Thor's hammer and stole the Sons' place of prestige. Even though they botched the handle, which the Sons grumble is the only part of hammer crafting that takes any real skill, the new smiths were still celebrated. This bitter rivalry would last for centuries.
